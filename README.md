To view the interface, open index.html in your browser.  (If you encounter cross-domain issues, you'll need to cd into the directory, run the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer", and then open localhost:8000.)

To change what game is showing, open index.html and find this line:
```javascript
<script src="js/game-complete-1.js"></script>
```

Change the src to the path of the game file you want to display.
